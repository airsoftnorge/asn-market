For the purposes of airsoft, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_Team_Awareness_Kit">Team Awareness Kit (TAK)</a> is a software suite capable of supporting mission planning and navigation, as well as communication and coordination between individuals, squads and entire teams on the airsoft field.
To facilitate the use of TAK in support of airsoft games in Norway, AirsoftNorge has set up the ASN-TAK infrastructure, consisting of three dedicated TAK servers for public use by airsofters across Norway.
