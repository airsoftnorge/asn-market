For the purposes of airsoft, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_Team_Awareness_Kit" target="_blank">Team Awareness Kit (TAK)</a> is a software suite capable of supporting mission planning and navigation, as well as communication and coordination between individuals, squads and entire teams on the airsoft field.
To facilitate the use of TAK in support of airsoft games in Norway, AirsoftNorge has set up the ASN-TAK infrastructure, consisting of three dedicated TAK servers for public use by airsofters across Norway.

In this article, we will cover the installation and initial setup of TAK on the android platform for use with our ASN-TAK servers.
You will at any time find the most recent version of ATAK on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atakmap.app.civ" target="_blank">the Google Play Store</a>

**That being said, before installation, there are a few things you should consider with privacy in mind:**
* ATAK uses the GPS/Location Services of your device to display your current geographic location, with a high degree of accuracy
* This location is visible to anyone else connected to the same server(s)
* Unless you turn on location Services before opening the app, your position will be displayed to other users on the server immediately upon launching the app
* Turning off location Services after opening app, will leave a marker displaying the location where Location Services were turned off.

__With this in mind, we highly recommend that you do not use the ATAK app with Lcation Services activated, while located in or around your home, or your workplace.__
Instead, while experimenting or familiarizing yourself with the app, keep Location Services turned off - and ensure that you close the app properly before turning them back on.
Another option is to use an Android emulator for PC (we have used <a href="https://www.bluestacks.com" target="_blank">Bluestacks</a> for this purpose in the past - which without GPS hardware will not give away your accurate location (_but may give the location of an ISP node near you_)
