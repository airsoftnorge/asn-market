This diagram shows the pinout for a Invisio downlead using a ODU AMC style plug, seen from the plug side, to be used with a 6pin nato connection, either a u283 or ap136. 

The 6pins are marked A->F, make sure to not short any connections as some radios provide power on the F pin. 

AP136 / U283 pinout: 
* A - gnd
* B - spk+
* C - ptt
* D - mic+
* E - various function/not standardised
* F - DC voltage/mic/rebro not standardised
