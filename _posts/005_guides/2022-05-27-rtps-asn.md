In this guide we'll go through the settings you can use with your [ATAK UAS](https://www.civtak.org/2021/09/22/uas-tool-now-publicly-available/), ATAK ICU or other compatible device/software to stream your video feed to others in TAK.

Some plugins are baked into your TAK application, others you might need to download from [tak.gov](https://tak.gov/)


#### Settins for ASN-TAK

It's important to only stream on your assigned team, as you do not want to broadcast your location to the other side.

* rtsp://red.airsoftnorge.com:8554/OlaAirsofter
* rtsp://blue.airsoftnorge.com:8554/OlaAirsofter
* rtsp://yellow.airsoftnorge.com:8554/OlaAirsofter

ASN-TAK will attempt to associate your callsigns last known location with the stream, no special characters can be used.

If your callsign does not match it will still be available in the video feed tab and location is assumed Lon/Lat 0.0.
