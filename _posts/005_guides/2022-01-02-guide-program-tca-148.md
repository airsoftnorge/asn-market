#### This guide assumes you have both a functional programming cable and access to the TCA-148 software. 
Both can be found [here](http://www.px-airsoft.com/showroom/model/T0002/templateProductDetails.do?ParentId=1324666353492015337%C2%A4tPage=1&editCurrentLanguage=1213907847692&webId=1213907847691&productId=1643131950020709686).
Inquire about the software on discord if you have a cable but no software.

#### Not all radios are identical so make sure you keep a backup of the original radio configuration!


Connect the TCA 148 to your computer, open the TCA-148 software and turn on the radio.

Select Program and download the current configuration from your radio:
