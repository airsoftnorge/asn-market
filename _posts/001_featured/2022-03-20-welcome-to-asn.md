AirsoftNorge.com is a site dedicated to the dissemination of knowledge and information throughout the Norwegian airsoft community.*

The airsoft community in Norway currently exists as a widely dispersed array of facebook groups, discord channels and smaller club-specific websites and forums.
An unfortunate side effect of this, is that unlike the era of large centralized discussion boards, there no longer is a persistent knowledgebase people can look up to find answers to questions that the community has answered a million times over.
Our hope is to change this, and turn ASN into the go-to site where the collective knowledge of the community can be documented and stored for anyone interested in the airsoft hobby.
