**AirsoftNorge.com is a site dedicated to the dissemination of knowledge and information throughout the Norwegian airsoft community.**

The online airsoft community in Norway currently exists as a widely dispersed array of facebook groups, discord channels and smaller club-specific websites and forums.

An unfortunate side effect of this, is that unlike the era of large centralized discussion boards, there no longer is a persistent knowledgebase people can look up to find answers to questions that the community has answered a million times over.

Our hope is to change this, and turn ASN into the go-to site where the collective knowledge of the community can be documented and stored for anyone interested in the airsoft hobby.

In service of this, we have changed our publishing language to English, in the hopes that content on our site can also serve as a resources airsofters outside of Norway going forward.

On our site, you will find introductory [guides for newcomers] ({{site.baseurl}}/beginners) to the airsoft hobby, guides and informations on the [ASN-TAK] ({{site.baseurl}}/tak), [resources] ({{site.baseurl}}/resources) like wiring diagrams for radio accessories, and a wide array of helpful instructional content and [guides] ({{site.baseurl}}/guides).
