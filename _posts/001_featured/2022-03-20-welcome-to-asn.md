**AirsoftNorge.com is a site dedicated to the dissemination of knowledge and information for the Norwegian airsoft community.**


The online airsoft community in Norway currently exists as a widely dispersed array of facebook groups, discord channels and smaller club-specific websites and forums.<br>
An unfortunate side effect of this, is that unlike the era of large centralized discussion boards, there no longer is a persistent knowledgebase people can look up to find answers to questions that the community has answered a million times over.

Our hope is to change this, and turn ASN into the go-to site where the collective knowledge of the community can be documented and stored for anyone interested in the airsoft hobby.<br>
In service of this, we have changed our publishing language to English, in the hopes that content on our site can also serve as a resources airsofters outside of Norway going forward.

On our site, you will find introductory [guides for newcomers]({{site.baseurl}}/beginners) to the airsoft hobby, guides and informations on the [ASN-TAK]({{site.baseurl}}/tak), [resources]({{site.baseurl}}/resources)like wiring diagrams for radio accessories, and a wide array of helpful instructional content and [guides]({{site.baseurl}}/guides).
