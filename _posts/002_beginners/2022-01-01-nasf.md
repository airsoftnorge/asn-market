The Norwegian Airsoft Association (NASF) serves a few main purposes that make it an incredible tool for you as a player.

#### The legal roadblock

As a recognized sports association with airsoft in their program they must be consulted before making any changes to laws that would impact airsoft as a sport in Norway. The existence of a recognized association like this is the best guarantee we can have for airsoft staying legal in Norway for the forseeable future. It's worth remembering that it was illegal up until 2001.

#### Common ruleset allows crossplay

A democratically voted for common set of rules makes crossplay between clubs easy and with the principle of it not being pay2win the rules are very beginner friendly. 

The rules can be changed if so desired in a general assembly that is organized once a year.

The ruleset mainly covers muzzle energy, safety distances and approved certification for safety glasses. 

#### Dental insurance
While accidents are rare, dental bills can be a heavy burden for some. NASF providing dental insurance for it's members when games are organized by NASF using the NASF ruleset let you enjoy the sport without excessive protective gear or fear of financial ruin.
